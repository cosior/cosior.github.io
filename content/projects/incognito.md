### IdeNtity verifiCatiOn with privacy-preservinG credeNtIals for anonymous access To Online services (INCOGNITO)

The overarching goal of INCOGNITO (IdeNtity verifiCatiOn with privacy-preservinG credeNtIals for anonymous access To Online services) is to combine state-of-the-art technologies in a platform that will allow users to easily understand what is needed to access online services with respect to their privacy and be able to prove specific attributes of their identity or their whole identity. We build on top of the framework that is being developed under the ReCRED project where we use advanced mobile software in order to convert online and physical identity proofs into validated and cryptographically strong proofs of identities that can be used for getting access to Online Services. INCOGNITO has the following objectives:

1. Design and implement an infrastructure that supports QUALIFIED ANONYMITY (QA) by leveraging state of the art cryptographic credentials schemes as well as Federated Login solutions.
2. Design and implement an Identity Acquisition and Management platform that will allow the user to quickly and securely acquire identity attributes from Physical ID documents and Online Identities.
3. Design and implement an advanced UI/UX AI-based assistant that will guide and inform the user about aspects of his identity management as well as possible actions to take.
4. Evaluate the results of the project through two pilot activities.

To achieve these objectives an inter-sectorial and interdisciplinary secondment program for Experienced and Early Stage Researchers that fosters knowledge exchange is proposed. Academic partners will offer their expertise on online identity acquisition and management, machine-learning algorithms and user experience assessment. Industry partners will offer their expertise on state-of-the-art IT security technologies, production-grade development processes, exposure to industrial research environment and relevant business issues and data.
