### Assisting Micro Enterprises to adopt and be compliant with GDPR

SMOOTH project assists Micro enterprises to adopt and be compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) by designing and implementing easy-to-use and affordable tools to generate awareness on their GDPR obligations and analysing their level of compliance with the new data protection regulation.

Micro-enterprises often lack resources in terms of time, finance, people and knowledge to understand and apply the GDPR requirements, leaving them exposed to involuntary breaches and fines.

SMOOTH project will provide micro enterprises with resources to adopt GDPR in a smooth manner without incurring to unnecessary or unaffordable costs and safeguarding the interests of the EU data subjects on data privacy and security.

On the one hand, SMOOTH will create awareness on the importance of being compliant with the new legislation delivering a practical GDPR interactive handbook tailored to guide micro enterprises through the GDPR requirements. On the other hand, SMOOTH will develop an advanced cloud-based platform for validating the GDPR compliance of their privacy policies, databases as well as their tracking elements in websites and mobile applications. Micro companies will be informed of the elements needed to be GDPR compliant and will be equipped with tailored tools and resources for solving any detected issues.

The project is born from technology partners and data protection authorities and will be co-designed and validated by actual micro companies with the aim of becoming the reference tool platform for GDPR Compliance.

#### Objectives of the project:
- To deliver a GDPR online interactive handbook for micro enterprises
- To implement a dissemination and communication plan for reaching at least 1 million European MSMEs
- To develop advanced technology for automatically assessing GDPR compliance of the MSMEs
- To generate compliance reports
- To pilot and assess the operational aspects of the platform
- To maximize the number of European MSMEs that use SMOOTH for the GDPR adoption
- To validate the market feasibility of the SMOOTH platform
