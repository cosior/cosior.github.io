Previously, he was a postdoctoral researcher at the Network Systems and Science Research Laboratory ([NetSySci](https://netsysci.cut.ac.cy/)) at Cyprus University of Technology and the [Max Planck Institute for Informatics](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/) in Germany. 
During his PhD studies he was fully funded by an FP7 EU grant (Marie Curie, Metrics ITN program), a collaborative project with [Universidad Carlos III de Madrid](https://www.uc3m.es/), the [Technical University of Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin/en/), and [Telefonica](https://www.telefonica.com/) I + D. 

<!-- His research interest focuses on measuring the extent of targeted advertising taking place on the wired and wireless web, establishing causality between observed targeted advertisements and past browsing behavior, and developing tools and obfuscation techniques for preserving one’s privacy in view of the revealed targeted advertisement methods. -->

His research focuses on network and distributed systems, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), applied ML, online privacy and cybersecurity. His work has been featured in top-tier conferences and journals, including SigComm, CoNext, PRL, IMC and WWW.

He holds a BSc in Computer Engineering and Informatics (2013) and MSc in Computer Engineering and Informatics (2014) from [Cyprus University of Technology](https://www.cut.ac.cy/). 
In 2015 he earned a second MSc. in Telematic Engineering from [Universidad Carlos III de Madrid](https://www.uc3m.es/). 
He completed his PhD (-Dr. -Ing.) at [Technische Universität Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin/) in 2019. 

<!-- Overall, he enjoy to work on the design and implementation of different crowdsourced web-based distributed systems that aim to help internet users to understand how their personal data are collected and used on the internet: -->

Dr. Iordanou is passionate about designing and implementing crowdsourced, web-based distributed systems that help internet users understand how their personal data is collected and used online. A short list of such tools is provided below:

- [eyeWnder](http://www.eyewnder.webredirect.org/), a new Real Time Web Advertisement Analyser.
- [$heriff](http://sheriff-v2.dynu.net/views/home), a browser add-on for detecting price discrimination in e-commerce.
- [EITR](https://eitr-experiment.networks.imdea.org/), a real time system that combines a browser extension and a distributed federated learning model to identifying sensitive URLs in real-time while the user browse the web. 
- (NEW) [pageInspector](https://pageinspector.costnet.mywire.org/) is an experimental web-page analyzer/visualizer to help users and web admins to inspect third party domain inclusions.
